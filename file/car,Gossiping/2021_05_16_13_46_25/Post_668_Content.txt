紐約時報MIHIR ZIVERI總之就是有人問紐約市長候選人，布魯克林房價中位數為何？幾乎大家都猜錯，有人猜十萬美元，有人猜八萬。正確答案是900,000美元（2500萬台幣）。紐約人因此認為住房問題嚴重，但市長卻漠不關心。（美國人真草莓，2500萬台幣的房子就在該該叫。）餸O YOU KNOW THE MEDIAN SALES PRICE FOR A HOME IN BROOKLYN?THE QUESTION, WHICH WAS RECENTLY POSED TO EIGHT MAYORAL CANDIDATES BY THE NEWYORK TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD, WAS NOT A TRICK. BROOKLYN IS A NOTORIOUSLY EXPENSIVE BOROUGH IN ONE OF AMERICA’S MOST EXPENSIVE CITIES, AND NEW YORK CITY’S HOUSING CRISIS PROMISES TO BE A MAJOR ISSUE IN THE COMING YEARS.YET THE RANGE OF RESPONSES GIVEN BY TWO OF THE CANDIDATES — OFF BY ROUGHLY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE — HAS TOUCHED OFF INCREDULITY AMONG NEW YORKERS.“IN BROOKLYN, HUH? I DON’T FOR SURE,” SHAUN DONOVAN, WHO HAS TOUTED HIS EXPERIENCE AS HOUSING SECRETARY UNDER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AND HOUSING COMMISSIONER UNDER MAYOR MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG,乸NSWERED. “I WOULD GUESS IT IS AROUND$100,000.”THE GUESS FROM RAYMOND J. MCGUIRE, AN INVESTMENT BANKER AND FORMER EXECUTIVE AT CITIGROUP WHO HAS SOUGHT TO WOO VOTERS WITH HIS FINANCIAL ACUMEN, INCLUDED SIMILAR NUMBERS.“IT’S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE IN THE $80,000 TO $90,000 RANGE, IF NOT HIGHER,”HE SAID.ERIC ADAMS, THE BROOKLYN BOROUGH PRESIDENT, SAID HE BELIEVED THE NUMBER WAS ABOUT $550,000. MAYA WILEY, A FORMER COUNSEL TO MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, GUESSED $1.8 MILLION. ONLY ANDREW YANG, WHO HAS BEEN CRITICIZED IN THE PAST FOR SEEMINGOUT OF TOUCH WITH THE CITY’S ISSUES, GUESSED CORRECTLY: $900,000.KATHRYN GARCIA, A FORMER SANITATION COMMISSIONER, GUESSED $800,000; DIANNE MORALES, A FORMER NONPROFIT EXECUTIVE, $500,000; AND SCOTT M. STRINGER, THE CITYCOMPTROLLER, $1 MILLION.WHILE MR. DONOVAN AND MR. MCGUIRE ARE NOT CONSIDERED AMONG THE LEADING CANDIDATES IN THE RACE, IT WAS THEIR ANSWERS THAT DREW THE MOST ATTENTION, WITH MANYPEOPLE SUGGESTING THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE A GRASP ON THE PROBLEMS OF WORKING PEOPLE. AS SEVERAL PEOPLE POINTED OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AMONG THE THINGS THAT CAN BE PURCHASED湶N BROOKLYN FOR $100,000 OR LESS, ACCORDING TO THE WEBSITE ZILLOW: A PARKING SPACE AND TWO VACANT LOTS.“IT’S HARD TO IMAGINE THESE MEN SOLVING A PROBLEM THEY DON’T KNOW EXISTS,” SAID MONICA KLEIN, A POLITICAL CONSULTANT. THE WORKING FAMILIES PARTY, WHICHHAS ENDORSED TWO OTHER CANDIDATES, MS. MORALES AND MS. WILEY, IS A CLIENT OF MS. KLEIN’S FIRM, SENECA STRATEGIES.“IF YOU DON’T SPEND YOUR DAYS REFRESHING STREETEASY AND OBSESSING OVER APARTMENTS YOU WILL NEVER AFFORD, ARE YOU REALLY A NEW YORKER?” MS. KLEIN ASKEDACCORDING TO A NOTE APPENDED TO A TRANSCRIPT OF THE EDITORIAL BOARD’S INTERVIEW WITH MR. DONOVAN, HE HAD SENT AN EMAIL SEVERAL HOURS AFTER THE INTERVIEW濳O SAY THAT HIS $100,000 ANSWER REFERRED TO THE ASSESSED VALUE OF HOMES IN BROOKLYN, WHICH TENDS TO BE MUCH LOWER THAN THEIR SELLING PRICE.“I REALLY DON’T THINK YOU CAN BUY A HOUSE IN BROOKLYN TODAY FOR THAT LITTLE,” HE WROTE, ACCORDING TO THE TRANSCRIPT.JEREMY EDWARDS, A SPOKESMAN FOR MR. DONOVAN, SAID TUESDAY THAT MR. DONOVAN “MISINTERPRETED THE QUESTION AND MADE A MISTAKE.”“HE HAD BEEN VOLUNTEERING ON A COMPLEX HOUSING ASSESSMENT LAWSUIT AND JUST GOT THE NUMBERS MIXED UP,” MR. EDWARDS SAID. “AS SHAUN SAYS, HE IS A HOUSING NERD AND PUBLIC SERVANT WHO HAS DEDICATED 30 YEARS OF HIS LIFE TO SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS, AND THE WRONG NUMBER SLIPPED OUT.”打錯，謝謝。布魯克林房價？市長候選人猜十萬元
